## Used Car Price Prediction

### ABSTRACT
---

Our project sets out to find the parameters to determine the price in used cars on the
market.

### Introduction
---

Previous research suggests the positive correlation between year and price and an inverse
relationship between mileage and price (Pudaruth, 2014). Other studies have employed
regression tree model, multiple regression, and lasso regression models to used car datasets.
Future work has been proposed for random forest methods and other machine learning models
(Venkatasubbu and Ganesh, 2019).


### Our Hypothesis
---

The context of our work is to use python to merge multiple data frames followed by a
NULL value analysis and outlier analysis. Our ultimate goal is to tell a data story to evaluate if
models within brands of Toyota and Ford have a higher price as well as notate the variation in
price between brands. We also were interested in the role of inflation in our dataset as well as the
impact year on the price of a car in the used car market. Another point of interest is to see if we
can expand the dataset with new car data gathered from APIs, once we have understood the basic
trends and patterns of the used car data.
